### Vent-ECS

Vent-ECS is a lightweight and
flexible [Entity Component System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) (ECS) library designed for
game development in Rust. It allows game developers to create entities and components, and easily handle their
relationships and interactions with each other.

### üèÜ Goals

- Lightweight and fast
- Flexible and customizable
- Supports both single-threaded and multi-threaded systems
- Designed to be used with the Vent Engine but can be used independently in other Rust projects
