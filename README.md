### 🏗 Current Status
-- Vent-Engine is in development --

We're using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Snowiiii/Vent-Engine/projects?query=is%3Aopen) for Managing our Tasks

#### Why not a Roadmap ?
There are several reasons why we don't find a roadmap useful.
Firstly, we believe that Vent-Engine should be released in a polished and fully functional state with all features included,
regardless of how long it takes. We have no time constraints, so we can focus on implementing as many polished features as possible without unnecessary stress.
Therefore, we do not see the need for a roadmap in this regard.

Contribution in any way shape or form is appreciated.
