### 🏗 Current Status

-- Vent-Engine is in development --

We're using [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/Snowiiii/Vent-Engine/projects?query=is%3Aopen) for Managing our Tasks

#### Why not a Roadmap ?

There are several reasons why we don't find a roadmap useful.
Firstly, we believe that Vent-Engine should be released in a polished and fully functional state with all features
included,
regardless of how long it takes. We have no time constraints, so we can focus on implementing as many polished features
as possible without unnecessary stress.
Therefore, we do not see the need for a roadmap in this regard.

#### How to Contribute

We welcome contributions in any way shape or form. Here's how you can get started:

- Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
- Run ```cargo run --release --bin vent-editor``` to start the editor.
- Make your changes and submit a pull request.

We also have [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Snowiiii/Vent-Engine/issues) where you can report bugs, request
features, or discuss ideas.
